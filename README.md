# WaterHeater
A small MicroPython project to add temperature control to existing electric water heater.

Dev Board: 
BPI-Leaf-S3
----
Parts used: 
1. 10k resistor
2. 10k NTC temperature sensor x 1
3. 5v Relay Switch
4. Multiple Dupont wires
----

An NTC(Negative Temperature Coefficient) resister is a variable resistor that responds to temperature changes.  The higher the temperature, the lower the resistance.
